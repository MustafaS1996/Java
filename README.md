**Information Security**
  To briefly understand the concept of simple substitution is simple, first the cipher receives a plaintext and then replaces letters in the plaintext to other coordinated letters thus creating a ciphertext. There are over 26! Keys to try for the substitution creator to choose from and so cracking will take some time. Although, using letter frequency analysis the attacker is able to count the numbers of letters which frequently appear and then replace them with frequent letters found in the language. Given a big enough ciphertext set, the analysis decryption will break the key.
